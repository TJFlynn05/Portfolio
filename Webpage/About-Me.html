        <p>
            You may ask who am I when coming across my website, my name is Tyler, I am in year 2 of my undergraduate degree in Games Design 
            and Programming at university and here's a bit about myself:
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't realise I would end up into programming until year 9 in highschool during the Covid-19 lockdown and I participated in a closed beta for double eleven
            ,this led me to be part of the development cycle of a game and I instantly fell in love with the process of getting the community
            involved in making a game that will be enjoyed by millions. I started to talk to the developers asking what role they had in development
            and I found out that they were a programmer. I talked to them about it for a while and it sparked my interest in programming, this led 
            me to start learning c++, it was quite difficult at first but I managed to do some basic input and output to the console, anything more
            complex than that and it became too much for me to understand so I stopped for a while but stayed in contact and asked more questions to the developer. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Fast forward to college I took a course that was [insert here] which was coursework based and the engine we used was unreal engine I have to admit 
            I struggled at first with this too but I managed to get a basic understanding of the tools and how to use them to design and decorate levels and as I started
            to understand the work I produced became better and looked more refined and this filled me with hope of the future. During the first year of college I did
            quite well up until the FMP (Final Major Project) where we had to work in a team to produce a game, the game idea was overscoped because I was unaware of
            how much work it would take and where everyone's skill levels were at, as deadline drew closer I was more focused on the programming but also trying to help out
            the team and fill gaps in where I could, this led to me not writing up on the work and this then led to a referral which then limited me to a pass for the first
            year. This affected me a lot and it put me down for a bit but as soon as second year came around I was determined to do better and I did, I managed to keep on top
            of my work and producing better quality work and by the end of the year I managed to make a game, which wasn't very mechanically complex but it was a challenge for
            me to produce this game as I overscoped intentionally with this project as I wanted to challenge myself to see what I could do and how much of the main game idea
            I could produce in the time frame. Ideas did have to be cut from the final game but I was happy with what I produced as I messed around with things I thought I
            could only dream of making. When it came to results day I was very stressed but I felt it was going to be better than last year, I opened the envelope and I got
            a distinction which led me into pursuing a degree in Games Design and Programming at university as I knew this was the career path I wanted to go down.
